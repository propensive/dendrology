Dendrology is available as a binary for Scala 3.4.0 and later, from [Maven
Central](https://central.sonatype.com). To include it in an `sbt` build, use
the coordinates:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.soundness" % "dendrology-tree" % "0.2.0"
libraryDependencies += "dev.soundness" % "dendrology-dag" % "0.2.0"
```
